===================

Font Nanny is based on the code of Glyph Nanny by Type Supply.

I added some basic lines in order to mark all suspicious glyphs in a font,
based on the options given by Glyph Nanny.

It simply colors suspicious glyphs in a font - 
when editing a single glyphs Glyph Nanny should be used for a 
detailed report on outline problems etc.
